## Experiment on Deep Learning

## Description

This experiment is part of a study on deep learning using Python and TensorFlow. The focus of the experiment is on image processing and applying various transformations such as rotation and brightness adjustments, followed by training a deep learning model.

The experiment includes:

- Loading and preprocessing image data.
- Applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation and brightness adjustments.
- Building and training a transfer learning model using VGG (Visual Geometry Group) architecture.
- Implementing early stopping based on training accuracy.

## Files

- **DLexp5.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the experiment, including data augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the experiment:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

To install the necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python scikit-learn

```
## How to Run

Open the DLexp5.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the dataset.
Run the cells to train the model using transfer learning (VGG).
The model will stop training once the accuracy reaches 99%, as defined in the custom callback function.
## Results

The goal of this experiment is to achieve high accuracy in classifying the augmented images. The notebook also logs accuracy metrics and includes the use of early stopping based on the training accuracy.
